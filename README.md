This repository contains various projects I've completed throughout college, either on my own or for a class.

The Projects folder contains various small problem sets and personal projects. 

The amazonics folder contains work for a class project done at the end of my junior year 
where my group analyzed correlations between product reviews for different Amazon products and between number and quality of product reviews in different Amazon categories.

The crimebusters folder contains work done for a class project where my group produced a map of crime in Chicago as well as analyzing correlations between 
different types of crimes across the US.

The folder titled descartes contains a personal project where I built my own trading algorithm mostly from scratch. I deployed this algorithm to the cloud for a few weeks,
and it's capable of trading live through the Alpaca API. A more detailed description of the algorithm's function can be found in the folder.

The Applied_Microeconometrics_Final folder contains the final writeup and Jupyter notebook for my final project for Applied Microeconometrics. I replicated a paper analyzing the impact of
emigration in 1800s Sweden on political outcomes in modern Sweden. The authors' code was written in Stata, so I rewrote their analysis in Python and also performed some 
original analysis.
